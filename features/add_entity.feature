Feature: User can manually add Entity

  As an authenticated user
  So that I can add new entities
  I want to add entity by giving the local ID

Scenario: Try to add already existing entity (sad path)

#  Given I log in as "User1" with "Password1"
#  Then I should be on the Entity Manager home page
#  When I have added "Sensor 1" with description "Sensor 1 from User1"
#  Then I should be on the Entity Manager home page  
#  And I should see "Sensor 1 already exists!"


#Scenario: Add an entity
#  Given I am on the Entity Manager home page
#  When I follow "Register new entity"
#  Then I should be on the Register New Entity page
#  When I fill in "Description" with "ebbits uuid for Sensor 1a"
#  And I fill in "LocalID" with "Sensor 1a"
#  And I press "Save Changes"
#  Then I should be on the Entity Manager home page
#  And I should see "ebbits uuid for Sensor 1a"
  
Scenario: view entity list after adding entities
#  Given I have added "Sensor 3" with description "ebbits uuid for Sensor 3"
#  And   I have added "Sensor 2" with description "ebbits uuid for Sensor 2"
#  And   I am on the Entity Manager home page #sorted by description
#  Then  I should see "Sensor 2" before "Sensor 3" on the Entity Manager home page
